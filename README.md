Welcome to the Census Income Dataset enhancement project! Our undertaking is to replace the widely used Census Income "adult" dataset with a newer, enhanced dataset that incorporates elements of social justice (based in research) for both students and teachers of machine learning. Our enhanced dataset is free to download and use, linked at our [landing page](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~alexwest/w210_census_income_html/), as are the supplemental materials, including a data dictionary, a white paper outlining the background of the project, an overview of our process and results, and finally a comprehensive literature review which explores the racial wealth gap and other work incorporating the concept of equity into data science and machine learning.

This repository contains the source code for our updating, supplementing, joining, EDA, and modeling efforts.
